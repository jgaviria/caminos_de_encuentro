# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization and
# are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other than
# English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t "hello"
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t("hello") %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more about the API, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# at https://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.
#
# Be aware that YAML interprets the following case-insensitive strings as
# booleans: `true`, `false`, `on`, `off`, `yes`, `no`. Therefore, these strings
# must be quoted to be interpreted as strings. For example:
#
#     en:
#       "yes": yup
#       enabled: "ON"

en:
  hello: "Hello world"

    faq:
      title: "Frequently Asked Questions"
      
      how_it_works:
        question: "How does Paths of Encounter work?"
        answer: "Our platform uses advanced matching algorithms to help you find your loved ones. Simply create a profile with the data of the person you are looking for, and our system will compare this information with our database to find possible matches."
      
      security:
        question: "Is my personal information secure?"
        answer: "Absolutely. We use state-of-the-art encryption and follow the highest security standards to protect all data. Your information is only used to facilitate the search and is never shared with third parties without your explicit consent."
      
      time:
        question: "How long does it take to find someone?"
        answer: "Time varies by case. Some searches may show results immediately if the person is already in our database, while others may take days, weeks or longer. Our system works continuously to increase the chances of success."
      
      information:
        question: "What information do I need to create a search?"
        answer: "You need as much information as possible: full name, approximate date of birth, physical characteristics, last known location and any other relevant details. The more information you provide, the more accurate the results will be."
      
      cancellation:
        question: "Can I cancel my plan at any time?"
        answer: "Yes, you can cancel your subscription at any time from your user panel. There are no permanence contracts or early cancellation penalties. Your access will continue until the end of the current billing period."
      
      international:
        question: "Do you offer support for international cases?"
        answer: "Yes, we work with a global network of organizations and databases. Our reach extends beyond national borders to help search for people who may have migrated or be in other countries."
